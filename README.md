## My process

### Built with

With the help of VCS Studio
- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

How to use github, i think i passed more time to understand how to upload and especially make a live site due to a problem in the deploying. I figured out that in the css there was one ";"missing. </br>
By using "root" you HAVE to name your html "index" </br>
with just that two change it passed from full red to full green. 

Otherwise, the "main" difficulty i got was to import and use a new font-familly ( The order in which you put the link matter more than i thought in the heading.) </br>
And aligning the box to the borders.

### Continued development

I mainly got some trouble to align the white square to the borders. I found a way to do it, but it might not be the most efficient. 


## Acknowledgments

I added a little bonus of mouse-over to the Qr code just for fun and try something
