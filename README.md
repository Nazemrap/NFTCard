### What I learned

Main difficulty was to get the little eye icone poping out of the NFT image. I had to cheat a little bit and check on other people. 
I found out the ::before ::after thing and after checking on few youtube video, i tried to do it my self but it was a bit hard for me. 

Also i learned a little bit more on the importance of the Mother and chill interaction, figured out that depending on who we apply style it might interact differently. 

### Continued development

I tryed to work a bit more with the flex box. I'm using black border now to see how block are and how they interact with each other. 

### Critic

On the final result, i'm happy overall, but there is still this imperfect thing:  the ETH and clock are not quite aline with the text next to it.
